# Oz Hacks
Oz Hacks is a site intended to provide practical and useful hacks for backpacking around Australia. The site is targeted at anyone of any age who is either planning to go backpacking or who is already backpacking in Australia. Oz Hacks will be useful for travellers as it provides top tips specifically for backpacking around Australia as opposed to anywhere else accompanied by applicable image, video and external link content.

## Design

### Page Designs

The pages are designed to flow as the user takes each step through the journey of the website. 

The Home Page has a large hero background image of a campervan synonymous with the user's backpacker journey and visit to the website starting. The cover text is in a box with rounded corners for larger screens and the box covers the whole background image for smaller screens and is partially transparent, revealing the hero image behind. This layout is repeated on the final Contact page with a sunset hero background image synonymous with the user's steps on the website coming to a close. The colour scheme for the cover text box is switched with the first page having a cream cover box and navy text and the Contact page flipping that to cream text and a navy cover box. The first and last pages having a matching layout brings the user full circle. 

The Before You Go and When in Oz pages have the same layout with the text boxes and photos/videos either being stacked on top of each other for smaller screens or being side by side for larger screens. The layout, whether on larger or smaller screens, creates a flow down the page encouraging the user to keep scrolling down to find out the next hack for backpacking Australia. On larger screens the hack text box and media appear on different sides of the screen as you scroll down creating a flow across as well as down the page. The hack text boxes and accompanying videos/images all have curved corners matching the cover text box on the Home and Contact pages.  

The Gallery page has a standalone structure with the photos appearing to be polaroids for smaller screens and having an overlapping structure on larger screens. The flow of the Gallery page does, however, link back to the Before You Go and When in Oz Pages with the first polaroid being on the left of the screen, the second being on the right etc and the overlapping structure on larger screens creating a familiar flow across as well as down the page.

## Features
### Existing Features
#### Home Page
* **Navigation Bar**

    The website is set up to take the user through a logical journey of separated steps via the easy-to-use navigation bar which includes links to all the pages and is the same on each page. Running left to right, the navigation bar reflects the stages the user is likely to go through in terms of both the stages of their trip and their likely primary and secondary goals for visiting the website as mentioned above. This helps the user find what they are looking for quickly and intuitively and provides a logical flow to the whole site. Its appearance on each page prevents visitors having to use the 'back' button. 
    [Info about feeback of nav bar]
* **Logo**
    The rotating compass logo provides a point of interest when arriving at the home page and is a consistent feature across all the pages. The compass imagery is part of the travelling theme of the website designed to evoke excitement about an upcoming or existing backpacking experience. 

    The Oz Hacks logo is also a consistent feature across all pages and when clicked on takes the user back to the home page which is a predictable and standard website convention. 

* **Header and Footer**
    
    The header contains the navigation links and has a background image of Uluru which is one of the most recognisable Australian landmarks as part of the consistent Australian and travelling imagery across the site designed to provide a positive user reaction for the target audience. 

    The footer contains contrasting ocean imagery and links to external useful websites for flights, hostels, visas and tripadvisor for Australian backpackers for users that want to further plan their trip. The links have a relevant logo and state what the link is for to provide clarity. [info about feedback of links]

* **Central Welcome Message**

    The welcome box has a small image to the left in keeping with the backpacking theme and a larger text box to the right which contains a welcome message. The message appears in the box as though it is being typed with a signature of the site author at the end of the message. This animation draws attention to the welcome message which helps users feel a connection to the author and her experience and encourages the user to continue browsing the site.

    The image and text box structure is repeated througout the Before You Go and When In Oz hacks pages to create consistency and familiarity for the user.  

#### Before You Go and When in Oz Pages
* **Presentation of Hacks**

    Both of the hacks pages following the same layout for predictability across the site and follow the smaller image/video and larger text box structure of the Home Page. 

    Each hack has a corresponding text box and either a video or image next to it to help the user further understand the hack. The hacks are piled one on top of the other creating content hinting to keep the user scrolling down the page until all the hacks have been seen. Where applicable the text for the hacks has external links where the user can find out further information relating to the hack to provide added value to the user. 

* **Animation**

    When these two pages are loaded, the boxes running either side of the centre of the screen come in from the right and left and appear to race each other until they meet in the centre. This animation feature is designed to provide a point of interest when these two pages are first opened and represents the text for the hack and the corresponding video/image coming together to inform the user. 

#### Gallery Page

* **Arrangement of Photos**

    The Gallery page provides an overlapping/stacked photo structure as you go down the page to create the idea of a scrapbook of travelling photos. As with the hacks, the stacking down the page creates content hinting encouraging the user to scroll to the bottom of the page. 

    When hovered over on a desktop, the relevant photo appears to come to the top of the pile for full viewing.
    
    Each photo has a caption stating the place name and the photos are grouped depending on the area of Australia to help the user quickly scroll to the area that they are interested in knowing more about. 
    
#### Contact Page

* **Structure**

    The Contact page has a similar structure to the Home Page to bring everything full circle and complete the user's journey through the site. 

* **Content**

    The page contains a form that visitors to the site can use if they have any queries or comments for the site author. The user is asked to provide their full name and email address and there is a button at the bottom of the form to submit it. 

* **Feedback**

    [Include details of form feedback using methods other than colour]
    
    
      On a tablet or mobile, the photos appear one at a time with horizontal scrolling to better suit the device type. 

#### Responsive Design

    The website needs to be equally visually appealing across desktop, tablet and mobile given that backpackers may be using this site at home on a desktop before travelling but may be reliant on a tablet or mobile whilst backpacking. 

    The header is adapted for tablet across all pages by moving the navigation links underneath the header and for mobile by using a hamburger icon for the navigation links and making the Uluru image the background to the Oz Hacks logo. 

    For the Gallery page the overlapping photos appearing on a dektop are changed to a single photo with horizontal scrolling for tablet and mobile.
