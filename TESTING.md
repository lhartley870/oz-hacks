## UX (User Experience) Stories Testing
1. As a first time user of the site, I want to see what the site is all about and the experience of the author so that I can decide whether it is worth exploring the site further.
    * Upon visiting the Home page the user is greeted with a large hero camper van background photo and a rotating compass logo in the header, both highlighting the theme of travelling/adventure and a clear website name in the header bar of 'Oz Hacks for backpacking Australia' immediately telling the user what the website is about.  
    * The partially transparent text overlay box with a text animation draws the eye of the user as if a message is being typed by the author just for them. The message is clear to read and brief, highlighting that the author has first hand experience of backpacking in Australia for two years.   

2. As a first time user of the site, I want to be able to easily navigate the site so that I can find exactly what I want quickly.
    * The navigation links to the different website pages are clearly set out in the header bar and the names of the pages clearly indicate what they are about. Having the site navigation at the top of the page is a common website convention that the user will be familiar with. 
    * When landing on the Home page, the user can, at a glance, see that the word 'Home' in the header is navy whereas the rest of the page names are cream and that the word 'Home' is underlined in a rust red colour whereas the other page names are not. This intuitively tells the user that a page name will turn navy once visited, blending in with the compass logo and Oz Hacks logo in the header bar, and that a rust red underline indicates the page that the user is currently on. The changing colour of the page links enables the user to easily keep track of which pages on the site they have visited.  
    * A cream (Sea Shell) coloured line appears underneath each page name when hovered over, indicating an action that the user can take to navigate to another page. 
    * The header bar is 'fixed/sticky', remaining at the top of the page at all times, even when the user scrolls down. This means that the site navigation is always quick and easy to reach, avoiding the user have to click the 'back' button or scroll back up to the top of the page to navigate to another site page. 

3. As a first time user of the site planning to backpack around Australia, I want to be able to find travel hacks that are applicable before I fly so that I can best plan my trip. 
    * The header bar has clearly named page navigation links so that seeing a page link entitled 'Before You Go' indicates to the user that this is the page to visit for Oz Hacks applicable before flying to Australia. 
    * Hovering over the Before You Go navigation link shows a cream underline indicating an action for the user to take.
    * Once the user lands on the Before You Go page the page link name is underlined in rust red, indicating that the user is on the required page and the heading at the top of the page matches the navigation link, further reassuring the user that they have ended up in the correct place. 

4. As a first time user of the site already backpacking in Australia, I want to be able to find travel hacks that are applicable to me now so that I can improve my current backpacking experience.
    * The navigation links follow a logical order in the header that is likely to reflect the user's primary and secondary goals when visiting the site and their backpacking journey. As the site primarily offers backpacking hacks, the Before You Go and When in Oz pages come after the Home page with Before You Go coming before When in Oz to reflect the order of the backpacker's travelling journey.  
    * A user who is already in Australia can quickly see that the Before You Go page is unlikely to be helpful and can instead move to clicking on the When in Oz page which clearly indicates that it offers advice for people already in Australia. 
    * As with the Before You Go page, hovering over the When in Oz navigation link shows a cream underline indicating an action for the user to take.
    * Once the user lands on the When in Oz page the page link name is underlined in rust red, indicating that the user is on the required page and the heading at the top of the page matches the navigation link, further reassuring the user that they have ended up in the correct place. 

5. As a returning user to the site having found the hacks useful, I want some inspiration for places to visit to inform my upcoming trip.
    * As inspiration for places to visit is likely to be a secondary goal of the user, ancillary to the primary goal of finding out some useful hacks for backpacking Australia, the Gallery page navigation link logically comes after the Before You Go and When in Oz page links in the header. 
    * The user will already be familiar with the site navigation and will already have seen the video accompanying Hack 2 on the When in Oz page which offers a flavour of places to visit so will be looking to the Gallery link for relevant photos of places to go. 
    * When reaching the Gallery page, the user is greeted with a sub-heading of 'North Coast and Centre' which indicates that the photos will be grouped according to areas of Australia (North, East, South and West), so that the user can scroll down to see photos applicable to the relevant area of Australia they are interested in. 
    * Each photo has a caption stating where the photo was taken to assist the user in planning their trip. 

6. As a returning user to the site having found the hacks useful, I want to contact the site author for advice on a specific issue to assist me ahead of my trip. 
    * The user will already be familiar with the site navigation and the page link named 'Contact' clearly indicates that that is the page the user will need to visit to contact the site author. 
    * When reaching the Contact page the user is greeted with a brief contact form which clearly sets out the information required from the user and gives them freedom to type their query in a text box. There is a dropdown box with plenty of options for the user to quickly select how long they are planning to stay in Australia and 3 radio button options for the user to confirm what they are planning to do in Australia.
    * The Send button is clear and has a cream shadow around it when hovered over indicating an action for the user to take. 

7. As a returning user to the site having found the hacks useful, I want to explore some of the hacks further to help me plan my trip more fully. 
    * The user will already be familiar with how to reach the Before You Go and When in Oz pages. 
    * The user can easily scroll down to the videos accompanying the hacks and watch those if they have not already done so and can click on the links to external websites included within the hack text. The links are easily identifiable as they are in a light blue colour and have a light blue underline when hovered over. Once visited the links turn navy and blend in with the rest of the hack text so that the user can keep track of which links they have already visited. However, the links can still be easily identified as the font size of the link wording is larger than the surrounding hack text, should the user want to re-visit a link in the future. 
    * Each external link opens up in a new tab so that the user can easily get back to the website.

8. As a returning user to the site having found the hacks useful, I want some useful links to book my flights and organise my visa. 
    * The footer contains icon links clearly showing what they represent. The plane icon clearly indicates flights and the file icon clearly indicates documentation. In any event, the user will know from reading Hack 5 on the Before You Go page that the file icon links to the Australian government's visa page as this is explicitly spelled out in the hack text. 
    * As the footer appears on every page, the user can access the footer links from anywhere on the site.  
    * As with the header, the footer links are a cream colour and turn navy once visited. The user will already be familiar with this behaviour from the site navigation links in the header. 
    * Again, as with the header, hovering over the footer icon links shows a cream underline indicating an action for the user to take.
    * Each external footer link opens up in a new tab so that the user can easily get back to the website. 

9. As a user of the site I want a comforting familiar layout as I explore the site with an attractive colour scheme and Australian imagery so that I can be inspired and excited about my upcoming/existing backpacking experience. 
    * Once the user has visited the Home page, they will be greeted with the same 'sticky/fixed' header bar which remains at the top of each page when scrolling and the same footer bar. 
    * The Home page and Contact page have a similar layout with a large hero background image and a partially transparent text overlay box. 
    * The Before You Go and When in Oz pages follow the same layout with each hack text box stacked on top of its accompanying media for smaller screens and the hack and media being adjacent on larger screens. 
    * Although the Gallery has a standalone layout, it follows the same flow as the Before You Go and When in Oz pages on larger screens by flowing across as well as down the page. 
    * The colour scheme has been carefully chosen to look attractive and is based on the Firebrick rust colour of the iconic Australian landmark Uluru. The Firebrick, Dark Salmon and Tan colours are reminiscent of sunsets and the outback with the Midnight Blue reminiscent of the desert sky at night and the cream Sea Shell, Tan and Sky Blue colours are reminiscent of the beach/coast. The outback and the beach are the key landscapes in Australia. 
    * There is Australian imagery throughout the site with the Home page having a hero image of a camper van at Manly Beach in Sydney and the Contact page having a hero image of surfers at Bondi Beach in Sydney. The Gallery page is full of images of places to visit across the whole of Australia.
