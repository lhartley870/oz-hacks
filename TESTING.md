# Testing

## Validators
[The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and [The W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) were used for testing the html and css code for the site. The following results show that no errors have been found: 
* [Home page html](/readme-documents/validation-results/index-validation.png)
* [Before You Go page html](/readme-documents/validation-results/before-you-go-validation.png)
* [When in Oz page html](/readme-documents/validation-results/when-in-oz-validation.png)
* [Gallery page html](/readme-documents/validation-results/gallery-validation.png)
* [Contact page html](/readme-documents/validation-results/contact-validation.png)

With the style.css file, validation was run using direct copying and pasting of the css code which gave [this result](/readme-documents/validation-results/css-direct-input-validation.png) with [this warning](/readme-documents/validation-results/css-warning.png) saying *'Imported style sheets are not checked in direct input and file upload modes'*. I therefore ran the style.css file validation using the URI which gave the following clear results:
* [style.css file](/readme-documents/validation-results/css-uri-validation.png) 
and the warning had disappeared (see [here](/readme-documents/validation-results/css-uri-results.png)).

Initially when the project was run through the html and css validators there were some errors and warnings which were addressed as follows:
* On the Before You Go and When in Oz pages there was an error saying that the *'frameborder attribute on the iframe element is obsolete'*. This attribute was deleted. There was also an error because a *'Your browser does not support iframe'* message had been included between the iframe tags by the developer. The error said that text was not allowed in the iframe element in this context. The message was instead put within a paragraph within the iframe tags but this also generated an error and so had to be deleted. There was also a double section closing tag on the When in Oz page which was deleted. 
* On the Contact page the validator picked up that there were two id attributes on the section element. One id was deleted and the CSS consolidated accordingly. A class had also accidentally been added to a div closing tag and was deleted. The validator also had an error saying *'The first child option element of a select element with a required attribute, and without a multiple attribute, and without a size attribute whose value is greater than 1, must have either an empty value attribute, or must have no text content. Consider either adding a placeholder option label, or adding a size attribute with a value equal to the number of option elements'*. This was resolved by adding an additional first option to the Contact form dropdown box (for a user to state for how long they would be visiting Australia) which had wording asking the user to select an option and had an empty value attribute.    

## UX (User Experience) Stories Testing
1. As a first time user of the site, I want to see what the site is all about and the experience of the author so that I can decide whether it is worth exploring the site further.

    ![Responsive view of live website Home page](/readme-documents/screenshots/home-page-screenshots.png)

    * Upon visiting the Home page the user is greeted with a large hero camper van background photo and a rotating compass logo in the header, both highlighting the theme of travelling/adventure and a clear website name in the header bar of 'Oz Hacks for backpacking Australia' immediately telling the user what the website is about.  
    * The partially transparent text overlay box with a text animation draws the eye of the user as if a message is being typed by the author just for them. The message is clear to read and brief, highlighting that the author has first hand experience of backpacking in Australia for two years.   

2. As a first time user of the site, I want to be able to easily navigate the site so that I can find exactly what I want quickly.

    ![View of header bar on larger screens](/readme-documents/screenshots/header-larger-screens.png)
    ![View of header bar on smaller screens](/readme-documents/screenshots/header-smaller-screens.png)

    * The navigation links to the different website pages are clearly set out in the header bar and the names of the pages clearly indicate what they are about. Having the site navigation at the top of the page is a common website convention that the user will be familiar with. 
    * When landing on the Home page, the user can, at a glance, see that the word 'Home' in the header is underlined in a rust red colour whereas the other page names are not. This intuitively tells the user that a rust red underline indicates the page that the user is currently on. 
    * A cream (Sea Shell) coloured line appears underneath each page name when hovered over or focussed on, indicating an action that the user can take to navigate to another page. 
    * The header bar is 'fixed/sticky', remaining at the top of the page at all times, even when the user scrolls down. This means that the site navigation is always quick and easy to reach, avoiding the user have to click the 'back' button or scroll back up to the top of the page to navigate to another site page. 

3. As a first time user of the site planning to backpack around Australia, I want to be able to find travel hacks that are applicable before I fly so that I can best plan my trip. 
    * The header bar has clearly named page navigation links so that seeing a page link entitled 'Before You Go' indicates to the user that this is the page to visit for Oz Hacks applicable before flying to Australia. 
    * Hovering over the Before You Go navigation link shows a cream underline indicating an action for the user to take.
    * Once the user lands on the Before You Go page the page link name is underlined in rust red, indicating that the user is on the required page and the heading at the top of the page matches the navigation link, further reassuring the user that they have ended up in the correct place. 

4. As a first time user of the site already backpacking in Australia, I want to be able to find travel hacks that are applicable to me now so that I can improve my current backpacking experience.
    * The navigation links follow a logical order in the header that is likely to reflect the user's primary and secondary goals when visiting the site and their backpacking journey. As the site primarily offers backpacking hacks, the Before You Go and When in Oz pages come after the Home page with Before You Go coming before When in Oz to reflect the order of the backpacker's travelling journey.  
    * A user who is already in Australia can quickly see that the Before You Go page is unlikely to be helpful and can instead move to clicking on the When in Oz page which clearly indicates that it offers advice for people already in Australia. 
    * As with the Before You Go page, hovering over the When in Oz navigation link shows a cream underline indicating an action for the user to take.
    * Once the user lands on the When in Oz page the page link name is underlined in rust red, indicating that the user is on the required page and the heading at the top of the page matches the navigation link, further reassuring the user that they have ended up in the correct place. 

5. As a returning user to the site having found the hacks useful, I want some inspiration for places to visit to inform my upcoming trip.

    ![Responsive view of live website Gallery page](/readme-documents/screenshots/gallery-page-screenshots.png)

    * As inspiration for places to visit is likely to be a secondary goal of the user, ancillary to the primary goal of finding out some useful hacks for backpacking Australia, the Gallery page navigation link logically comes after the Before You Go and When in Oz page links in the header. 
    * The user will already be familiar with the site navigation and will already have seen the video accompanying Hack 2 on the When in Oz page which offers a flavour of places to visit so will be looking to the Gallery link for relevant photos of places to go. 
    * When reaching the Gallery page, the user is greeted with a sub-heading of 'North Coast and Centre' which indicates that the photos will be grouped according to areas of Australia (North, East, South and West), so that the user can scroll down to see photos applicable to the relevant area of Australia they are interested in. 
    * Each photo has a caption stating where the photo was taken to assist the user in planning their trip. 

6. As a returning user to the site having found the hacks useful, I want to contact the site author for advice on a specific issue to assist me ahead of my trip. 

    ![Responsive view of live website Contact page](/readme-documents/screenshots/contact-page-screenshots.png)

    * The user will already be familiar with the site navigation and the page link named 'Contact' clearly indicates that that is the page the user will need to visit to contact the site author. 
    * When reaching the Contact page the user is greeted with a brief contact form which clearly sets out the information required from the user and gives them freedom to type their query in a text box. There is a dropdown box with plenty of options for the user to quickly select how long they are planning to stay in Australia and 3 radio button options for the user to confirm what they are planning to do in Australia.
    * The Send button is clear and has a Dark Salmon shadow around it when hovered over indicating an action for the user to take. 

7. As a returning user to the site having found the hacks useful, I want to explore some of the hacks further to help me plan my trip more fully. 

    ![View of Before You Go page on larger screens](/readme-documents/screenshots/before-go-large-screen.png) ![View of Before You Go page on smaller screens](/readme-documents/screenshots/before-go-small-screen.png)
 
    * The user will already be familiar with how to reach the Before You Go and When in Oz pages. 
    * The user can easily scroll down to the videos accompanying the hacks and watch those if they have not already done so and can click on the links to external websites included within the hack text. The links are easily identifiable as they have a larger font size than the surrounding text, appear in a Teal colour and have a Teal underline when hovered over or focussed on.
    * Each external link opens up in a new tab so that the user can easily get back to the website.

8. As a returning user to the site having found the hacks useful, I want some useful links to book my flights and organise my visa. 

    ![View of site footer](/readme-documents/screenshots/footer-screenshot.png)
    
    * The footer contains icon links clearly showing what they represent. The plane icon clearly indicates flights and the file icon clearly indicates documentation. In any event, the user will know from reading Hack 5 on the Before You Go page that the file icon links to the Australian government's visa page as this is explicitly spelled out in the hack text. 
    * As the footer appears on every page, the user can access the footer links from anywhere on the site.  
    * As with the header, hovering over or focussing on the footer icon links shows a cream underline indicating an action for the user to take. The user will already be familiar with this behaviour from the site navigation links in the header. 
    * Each external footer link opens up in a new tab so that the user can easily get back to the website. 

9. As a user of the site I want a comforting familiar layout as I explore the site with an attractive colour scheme and Australian imagery so that I can be inspired and excited about my upcoming/existing backpacking experience. 
    * Once the user has visited the Home page, they will be greeted with the same 'sticky/fixed' header bar which remains at the top of each page when scrolling and the same footer bar. 
    * The Home page and Contact page have a similar layout with a large hero background image and a partially transparent text overlay box. 
    * The Before You Go and When in Oz pages follow the same layout with each hack text box stacked on top of its accompanying media for smaller screens and the hack text and media being adjacent on larger screens. 
    * Although the Gallery has a standalone layout, it follows the same flow as the Before You Go and When in Oz pages on larger screens by flowing across as well as down the page. 
    * The colour scheme has been carefully chosen to look attractive and is based on the Firebrick rust colour of the iconic Australian landmark Uluru. The Firebrick, Dark Salmon and Tan colours are reminiscent of sunsets and the outback with the Midnight Blue reminiscent of the desert sky at night and the cream Sea Shell, Tan, Teal and Sky Blue colours are reminiscent of the beach/coast. The outback and the beach are the key landscapes in Australia. 
    * There is Australian imagery throughout the site with the Home page having a hero image of a camper van at Manly Beach in Sydney and the Contact page having a hero image of surfers at Bondi Beach in Sydney. The Gallery page is full of images of places to visit across the whole of Australia. 

## Manual Testing of Functionality and Responsiveness on Every Page

The manual testing of the website was carried out on the following devices:

1. Mobile phone (Apple iPhone 5S with a device viewport size of 320px by 568px)
2. Mobile phone (Apple iphone 11 with a device viewport size of 414px by 896px)
3. Tablet (Apple iPad mini with a device viewport size of 768px by 1024px)
4. Laptop (Apple Macbook Pro with a device viewport size of 1440px by 900px)
5. A large monitor (Asus monitor with a device viewport size of 1920px by 1080px) connected to the Macbook Pro

The website was tested on the following browsers on all of the above devices:

1. [Google Chrome](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/?brand=FHFK&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3b-xi9y38QIVBrTtCh2I1g3AEAAYASAAEgJN5vD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
2. [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)
3. [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/)
4. [Safari](https://www.apple.com/uk/safari/) 

The site was created using the Chrome browser and Chrome DevTools and was fully tested in that environment as it was being developed by testing all of the points mentioned below and the responsiveness of the site, all of which behaved as expected. The site was then further tested after deployment on all of the above devices and browsers. The testing comments below apply to all of the above devices and browsers, unless otherwise specified. 

### Home Page

1. The typing animation on page load and constant compass logo rotation animation work as expected. 
2. A cream Sea Shell coloured line appears under each of the page navigation links in the header and the footer icon links when hovering over them or focussing on them on the laptop and large monitor and when tapping on them on the touch screen devices. 
3. A rust Firebrick coloured line appears under the Home page navigation link as expected to indicate that the user is on the Home page.  
4. Clicking on all of the other site page links in the header takes the user through to the relevant page as expected on all devices. 
5. Clicking on all of the footer icon links takes the user through to the expected external sites, with each external site opening up in a new tab. 
6. Clicking on the Oz Hacks title logo Home page link keeps the user on the Home page. Whether the link works on the laptop and monitor was tested by clicking on the Oz Hacks title logo which kept the user on the Home page and re-started the typing animation which is triggered by the page loading, indicating that the link worked. On the tablet and mobile devices tested, tapping the Oz Hacks logo also triggered the typing animation indicating that the link works. 
7. The Home page appears as expected on all browsers on the laptop and monitor screens with the page adjusting itself to the available viewport height without the user having to scroll down at all. This was the intention of setting flexible viewport height values for the header, main section and footer so that the full Home page would always appear within the available screen viewport height without the page overspilling and the user having to scroll down to see the full footer. For Chrome and Edge, if the toolbar is hidden on the laptop and monitor, the Home page expands to take up the extra available screen viewport height as expected. On Safari when the toolbar is hidden a white strip remains at the top of the screen in place of the toolbar. However, other websites were visited and it was found that this behaviour occurs for those as well so this was found to be a general Safari browser behaviour and not something unique to the Oz Hacks site. It is not possible to hide the toolbar in the Firefox browser without implementing add-ons but when the Home page was tested on the monitor it adjusted to take up the new viewport height available so this indicates that the viewport height adjustment is working as expected for the Home page on laptop and monitor screens.  
8. The sizing of the header, background hero image section and footer of the Home page when switching between laptop and monitor screens is as expected. The font sizes become bigger on the monitor screen as expected. 
9. The full screen was exited on the laptop and monitor and the window was made the smallest it could be and was then expanded until it took up the full screen again. The Home page was fully responsive at all points and displayed as expected as the screen window size was changed in all browsers tested. The Home page adjusted at all times to fill the entire viewport without having to scroll down. Scrolling was only required when the viewport height was reduced to below the applicable minimum height set for the Home page e.g. 525px on mobile sized screens as the header is set to a minimum height of 150px, the footer to 75px and the hero section to 300px. 
10. On tablet, the Home page appears as expected in all browsers in both portrait and landscape view (save as set out in point 11 below). The header, background hero image section and footer re-size between the portrait and landscape views as expected and all the font sizes adjust as expected. The cream/Sea Shell cover text box is closer to the left edge of the screen than for the laptop and monitor screens in landscape mode and is flush to the left hand edge of the screen in portrait mode, all as expected. 
11. On tablet, the Home page only fits within the available viewport height, without having to scroll down to see the rest of the footer, in the Edge and Firefox browsers in portrait view. In the Chrome, Safari, Edge and Firefox browsers in landscape view the footer is fully or almost fully cut off and in the Chrome and Safari browsers in portrait view it is partially cut off. Having done some research into this, it seems this may be because the browsers count the address bar as part of the viewport height so a 100vh value will include the address bar as well as the website. Whilst this doesn't affect the functionality of the Home page it is not the view intended by the creator for the Home page. Please see the Unfixed Bugs section below for how to potentially deal with this in a future release using JavaScript.
12. On the mobile phones tested, the Home page appears as expected in all browsers in both portrait and landscape view (save as set out in point 13 below). The header, background hero image section and footer re-size between the portrait and landscape views as expected and all the font sizes adjust as expected. The cream/Sea Shell cover text box covers the entirety of the background image as expected on the iPhone 11 in portrait view and in both portrait and landscape view on the iPhone 5S and the page navigation links are stacked on top of each other instead of being adjacent to each other in portrait view on the iPhone 11 and in both portrait and landscape view on the iPhone 5S. The landscape view on the iPhone 11 is the same as the portrait view for the iPad mini. 
13. Similarly to the tablet, the Home page does not fit within the available viewport height in portrait view without having to scroll down to see the rest of the footer in any of the browsers on either mobile device, with the exception of the Edge and Firefox browsers on the iPhone 11. It was never intended that the entirety of the Home page would fit within a mobile landscape view and so the scrolling required there is expected. As mentioned in point 11 above, please refer to the Unfixed Bugs section for further discussion of this.    

### Before You Go Page

14. The constant compass logo rotation animation in the header works as expected.
15. Items 2-5 tested for the Home page were repeated and work as expected. For Item 3 the rust Firebrick coloured line appears instead under the Before You Go page navigation link. 
16. Item 6 was tested for the Before You Go page by clicking or tapping on the Oz Hacks logo which takes the user back to the Home page. 
17. A Teal coloured line appears under each of the external website links within the hack text when hovering over or focussing on them on the laptop and large monitor and when tapping on them on the touch screen devices.
18. Clicking on all of the external page links takes the user through to the expected external sites, with each external site opening up in a new tab. 
19. The page layout and sizing is as expected on the laptop and large monitor for the Chrome, Edge and Firefox browsers. The hack text and accompanying media are adjacent and an animation occurs on page loading creating a row gap between each hack and media pairing and closing the column gap between the hack text boxes and accompanying media so that they sit flush against each other. 
20. Safari does not support CSS grid animation so the appearance of the page on larger screens is usually the appearance that is seen at the start of the animation on the other browsers. However, sometimes, particularly if the window is minimised and then maximised back to full screen again, Safari displays the view that is seen at the end of the animation on the other browsers. Safari also displays the Before You Go page on the laptop with the view expected for a screen width of between 1024px but less than 1440px even though the screen is 1440px wide and is treated as such on the other browsers.  
21. The full screen was exited on the laptop and monitor and the window was made the smallest it could be and was then expanded until it took up the full screen again. The Before You Go page was fully responsive at all points and displayed as expected as the screen window size was changed in all browsers tested (with the exception of the issues raised at point 20 above). 
22. The hack photos appear as expected on the laptop, monitor and tablet and the embedded videos play and work as expected on those devices. The videos do not autoplay, as expected as per the default parameter for embedded YouTube videos. On the larger screens where the size of the video matches the size of the hack text box, for symmetry purposes it is expected that black lines will appear above and below the videos so that they maintain the correct aspect ratio.
23. On the tablet device, the page appears as expected in both portrait and landscape view on all browsers. In portrait view the photos and videos are the same width as the hack text boxes and in landscape view the photos and videos are half the size of the hack text boxes. As the size of the videos is not dictated by any adjacent text box on smaller screens, the aspect ratio of the videos is able to adjust so that there are no black lines around the videos when they are playing giving the videos a clean borderless appearance. The videos play within their containers on the webpage. 
24. On the mobile devices tested, the page appears largely as expected in both portrait and landscape view with the hack photos and videos being the same width as the hack text boxes in portrait view and the videos and photos being half of the width of the hack text boxes in landscape view. However, only on the Chrome browser on iPhone 5S, the videos and photos remain the full width of the hack text box in landscape view instead of shrinking to half the size. On the iPhone 11 and iPhone 5S when the user taps on a video to play it, it remains within its container on the webpage for all browsers when playing. On the iPhone 11 the user has the option to make the videos full screen but on iPhone 5S the button for the user to make the videos full screen is not there except in Chrome when the phone is viewed in landscape. The videos do fit within the screen in landscape mode under the header on the iPhone 5S so can be viewed and on Chrome where the video is too big to fit within the screen in landscape mode, the user is able to make the video full screen, so it is workable.    

### When in Oz Page

25. The same testing was carried out for the When in Oz page as for the Before You Go page and the results are as per the comments at points 14-24 above save that for Item 3 the rust Firebrick coloured line appears instead under the When in Oz page navigation link.

### Gallery Page

29. The same testing was carried out for the Gallery page as for the Before You Go page points 14-16 and the results are as per the comments set out in those points save that for Item 3 the rust Firebrick coloured line appears instead under the Gallery page navigation link. 
30. The page layout and sizing is as expected on the laptop and large monitor for the Chrome, Edge and Firefox browsers. The photos are overlapping as they go down the page and all of the captions are visible and readable and the area surrounding each photo caption is even for all photos. When hovering over each photo a Dark Salmon shadow appears around the photo and its caption and the photo appears to come to the top of the stack and is fully visible and not overlapped by other photos. The width of the gallery changes as the user goes from the laptop to monitor screen so that the photos do not appear too big. Safari displays the Gallery page on the laptop with the view expected for a screen width of between 1024px but less than 1440px even though the screen is 1440px wide and is treated as such on the other browsers. However, the Safari browser works as expected in all other respects.    
31. The full screen was exited on the laptop and monitor and the window was made the smallest it could be and was then expanded until it took up the full screen again. The Gallery page was fully responsive at all points and displayed as expected as the screen window size was changed in all browsers tested. 
32. On the tablet device, the page appears as expected in both portrait and landscape view on all browsers tested. In portrait view the photos and videos have the appearance of being polaroids and in landscape view the photos have the overlapping structure seen on the laptop and monitor. Tapping on the photos in landscape view creates the same Dark Salmon shadow and 'top of the stack' behaviour as the view on laptop/monitor, as expected. 
33. On the mobile devices tested, the page appears as expected in both portrait and landscape view on all browsers. In both views the photos have a polaroid appearance with the caption font size changing accordingly between portrait and landscape view. On some of the photos on the iPhone 5S and iPhone 11 some of the captions go onto two lines in both portrait and landscape view but do not overspill the polaroid. 

### Contact Page
34. The same testing was carried out for the Contact page as for the Before You Go page points 14-16 and the results are as per the comments set out in those points save that for Item 3 the rust Firebrick coloured line appears instead under the Contact page navigation link. 
35. The page layout and sizing is as expected on the laptop and large monitor screen sizes for all the browsers tested, save that the Safari browser displays the Contact page on the laptop with the view expected for a screen width of between 1024px but less than 1440px even though the screen is 1440px wide and is treated as such on the other browsers. However, the Safari browser works as expected in all other respects. The background image remains fixed as the user scrolls down the page and the whole form box fits within the screen without having to scroll down. 
36. Text can be typed within the text boxes for first and last names, email address and the advice requested on all browsers on all devices and a blue or black line appears around the text box when selected by the user and a cursor appears. The dropdown menu for the user to confirm the expected duration of their stay in Australia works on all devices and browsers with "Less than one month" being shown as the default option. The radio buttons for the user to confirm what they are planning to do in Australia are selected with a royal blue or grey circle depending on the browser on laptop or a small grey circle on tablet and mobile. When hovered over on laptop/monitor and when tapped on the touch screen devices a Dark Salmon shadow appears around the Send button. 
37. If the user tries to send the form without filling out the text boxes, a message appears asking the user to fill out the text boxes. If the user includes text in the email address that does not have an @ and tries to send the form, the user is prompted to include an @ in the email address. In the Firefox browser on laptop the user is prompted to fill out the email box and as the user starts typing they are prompted to include an @. If they fail to do so, pressing the Send button just takes the user back to the email address box until an @ is included. If the user tries to send the form without selecting one of the radio button options, the user is prompted to do so. If the user tries to select the "Please choose an option below" option from the dropdown list and send the form the user is asked to choose an item from the list. At the moment if the user sends the form the form just goes back to the starting position as expected as the back end functionality for the form is not yet in place.
38. On the Chrome and Safari browsers on the laptop and monitor the dropdown background colour is grey with black text and a royal blue background colour and white text indicates the option being hovered over. On the Edge browser the background colour is the Midnight Blue selected by the author with cream/Sea Shell text and a grey background and black text indicates the option being hovered over. On the Firefox browser the background colour is the Midnight Blue selected by the author with cream/Sea Shell text and a royal blue background indicates the option being hovered over. 
39. The full screen was exited on the laptop and monitor and the window was made the smallest it could be and was then expanded until it took up the full screen again. The Contact page was fully responsive at all points and displayed as expected as the screen window size was changed in all browsers tested. 
40. On the tablet device, the page appears as expected in both portrait and landscape view on all browsers tested. In portrait view the box containing the form is flush to the left edge of the screen and in landscape view the box moves slightly inwards from the left of the screen. The dropdown options have a light grey background and black text with a tick indicating the option selected on all browsers tested.  
41. On the mobile devices, the page appears as expected in both portrait and landscape view on all browsers. The navy/Midnight Blue cover text box covers the entirety of the background image as expected on the iPhone 11 in portrait view and in both portrait and landscape view on the iPhone 5S and the page navigation links are stacked on top of each other instead of being adjacent to each other in portrait view on the iPhone 11 and in both portrait and landscape view on the iPhone 5S. The landscape view on the iPhone 11 is the same as the portrait view for the iPad mini. The dropdown menu appears the same in all browsers with a light grey background, black text and the user having to scroll and touch to select an option. 

## Further Testing

### Friends and Family

Friends and family were sent a link to the site to highlight any user experience or appearance issues. The following devices and browsers were tested without any issues being flagged:
* iPhone XS - Safari browser
* iPhone 12 - Safari browser
* Moto G9 Plus - Chrome browser
* Amazon Fire HD 10 - Chrome browser 
* Windows 10 LG 24UD58 24 inch 4K UHD monitor - Microsoft Edge browser
* Samsung A21 - Chrome browser

### Colour Contrast Tool

The text colours and their background colours were tested using the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). Only the navy/Midnight Blue and rust/Firebrick colours were deemed acceptable on the checker for text on all of the coloured backgrounds used. However, where text is in the cream/Sea Shell colour and the light blue/Sky Blue colour, I chose to keep these colours as they are largely used for unvisited links and change to the darker navy colour when the links are visited. Also, for colour blind users with Monochromacy/Achromatopsia who can only see black, white and grey, the contrast between the cream/Sea Shell and navy/Midnight Blue and light blue/Sky Blue and navy/Midnight Blue colours allows such users to easily distinguish which links have been visited and which have not, whereas such users would not be able to tell the difference if the rust/Firebrick colour was used for unvisited links, turning to navy/Midnight Blue for visited links.   

## Fixed Bugs

* When trying to make the header 'fixed/sticky' at the top of each page, the header was not taking up the full width of the page and was becoming squashed. This was resolved by adding width: 100% to the header. 
* Initially the text-decoration property was used with an overline value to create the rust/Firebrick line between the 'Oz Hacks' and 'for backpacking Australia' wording in the title logo. However, once the site was deployed this rust line did not show up on the iPad, iPhone 5S and iPhone 11 for the browsers tested. This was resolved by replacing the text-decoration property with a border-top property instead. 
* When the site was deployed, some of the text did not look right in the various browsers tested on the iPad or iPhones. The text appeared more spaced out than it should have been. This was particularly noticeable because in the landscape view of the iPad the Contact page navigation link was being pushed underneath the other page navigation links instead of them all being alongside each other and the cursor typing animation on the Home page was partially cutting off the 'e' at the end of 'Lianne'. It was discovered from this [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5069752/ios-4-2-webfont-ttf-s-bold-font-weight-rendering-bug/11879044#11879044) that this was because using a font-weight of bold on Google Fonts where a non-bold version of the Google Font had been imported into the CSS stylesheet created a 'faux bold' styling causing the letters to space out. I resolved this by using a combination of Solutions 1 and 2 in Spoike's advice on that Stack Overflow post. I selected the Google Font weights I wanted, including two versions of the Roboto font (one being normal and one being medium) and then specified a font-weight within the CSS stylesheet that matched up with a font-weight that had been imported for the applicable font.   
* With the typing animation on the Home page, using a 'to' width of 100% in the keyframes at rule meant that the cursor skipped over the word 'Lianne' to the edge of the cover text box and then back to the end of the word instead of stopping at the end of the word. This was resolved by changing the 'to' width to an appropriate px width and including a width property for the #signature id (which styles the animated word 'Lianne') with the same px width. The px width then had to be increased appropriately when the font size of 'Lianne' was increased for larger screens. 
* A border-radius was applied to the container divs for the hack photos and embedded videos on the Before You Go and When in Oz pages. Whilst this made the videos and photos have curved edges in Chrome DevTools when the site was being built, when it was deployed the embedded videos had square edges on the iPhones and iPad used for testing the site. To resolve this a z-index was placed on the container div styling as suggested by shadeydave in [this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6535217/css-adding-border-radius-to-an-iframe). 
* Also, when the site was deployed, the hack photos on the Before You Go and When in Oz pages had rounded corners as intended in portrait orientation on the iPhone but when the iPhone was switched to landscape orientation, the photos had square corners. This was resolved by repeating the border-radius on the styling for the img elements themselves as well as for their container divs. 
* Code suggested by Michael Coker on Stack Overflow ([see here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43954836/disabling-blackbars-on-youtube-embed-iframe)) was used to maintain the aspect ratio of the embedded YouTube videos on the Before You Go and When in Oz pages but as the screen was adjusted in Chrome Devtools, slight black edging was sometimes appearing on the top, right, bottom or left of the videos when they were playing. This was resolved thanks to [this solution on GitHub from Patrick Grey](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/26284) by adding an inset clip-path on the styling for the iframe elements.
* On the Before You Go and When in Oz pages the edges of the hack text boxes were not flush to the edges of the adjacent embedded videos in screens 1440px+ wide. To resolve this a negative margin was added on the iframes as the clip-path on the iframe embedded videos to stop the youtube black background showing through caused there to be a gap between the video and the hack text box next to it. The negative margin brought the edges of each video and text box next to it together without a gap but the trade off was that the videos had more square corners on the side of the video that met the edge of the hack text box. Also, even with the negative margin on the iframes, the embedded videos on the When in Oz page still had a gap between them and the text box next to them. Splitting the negative margin required between the When in Oz page iframe div containers and the text boxes next to 
them gave the best result in terms of minimising a black line appearing down the right hand side of the iframe videos. 
* When writing the html to embed the YouTube videos, copying and pasting the link to the YouTube video would not embed it. I found the solution in [this YouTube article on Embedded Players and Player Parameters](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters) which showed the correct url format to end in '/embed/VIDEO_ID' and that you could not just copy and paste the url from the applicable YouTube page.
* When the site was deployed, on the iPhones tested, the embedded videos were largely automatically playing in full screen but one was playing within its container on the iPhone 11. To maintain consistency across all devices the parameter of playsinline=1 was added to the end of the html urls and this made all the videos play within their containers. This solution was obtained from David's answer in [this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33367473/display-youtube-video-inline-on-ios-devices/40961655#40961655). 
* When the site was built using Chrome DevTools, the gallery displayed as intended with all of the photo captions in the stacked view on screens 1024px+ wide having equal space around them. However, when the site was deployed, the photos in the stacked view were covering up the captions of the photos above on the iPad mini in landscape view in all browsers tested and in the Safari brower on laptop. Also, the bottom of the polaroid effect on the photos on the iPad mini in portrait mode and on the iPhones tested looked too big. Adding additional bottom padding to the photo and caption containers stopped the photos covering up the captions but made the spaces around the captions uneven on the iPad in landscape and created a discrepancy between the bottom padding of the polaroid effect between mobile and laptop. If it looked right on mobile it looked wrong on laptop and vice versa. This was fixed thanks to [this Stack Overflow answer given by hrood](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55347359/why-is-css-grid-row-height-different-in-safari) by making the section container of the gallery grid display as a grid itself and adding a height of 100% to the #gallery-container.
* Making the section container of the gallery grid display as a grid itself and then adding bottom padding or a bottom margin to that section to keep a gap between the last gallery photo and the footer created the spacing problems solved in the bullet above. To resolve this, on the Gallery page only, a margin-top was added to the footer instead. 
* On the Contact page, on the Firefox and Edge browsers on laptop, the background colour of the options when the dropdown bar was clicked on to answer the question about the period for which the user was planning on visiting Australia was white so the cream/Sea Shell (#fff5ed) wording was very difficult to see. To resolve this the background-colour of the option elements was targeted and set to Dark Salmon (#dc9c85) so that the option wording could be seen on laptop on those browsers.  

## Unfixed Bugs

* As referred to in points 12 and 14 of the Home page testing section above, it was the intention for the Home page to take up the full available viewport height of any device without overspilling so that the user would not have to scroll down at all. Whilst this worked on all browsers on the laptop tested, this was not the case for the tablet and mobile devices, save for the Edge and Firefox browsers in portrait view. In a further release I would like to try implementing a JavaScript solution to see if this can be addressed such as [this proposed solution from CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/the-trick-to-viewport-units-on-mobile/). I did try the [Matt Smith solution for ios Safari](https://allthingssmitty.com/2020/05/11/css-fix-for-100vh-in-mobile-webkit/) mentioned in the CSS-Tricks article by adding the suggested min-height CSS rules for the html and body elements but this did not fix the issue. Also, as a separate but related issue, whilst the Samsung native browser was not tested by the author, a friend who tested the website did try it on the Samsung browser and whilst the site worked well in landscape view, the Home page was squashed in portrait view indicating that something is perhaps going wrong with the vh sizing used for the site. An alternative fix would therefore be required to make the site work across a wider range of browsers. 
* Only on the iPhone 11 in landscape view and only on the Edge and Firefox browsers, the shadow around the compass logo is very slightly cut off indicating that the very left edge of the header bar is being cut off. The portrait view on the tablet has the same settings as the iPhone 11 in landscape in terms of how the website displays but this cutting off does not happen on the iPad.  
* The display of the Before You Go and When in Oz pages on the Safari browser on the laptop and monitor, tested as discussed at point 22 above. When Safari displays these pages as if the grid animation has occurred, some of the hack text boxes are not quite flush to the edge of the corresponding video/photo on the Before You Go page. When Safari displays these pages as if the grid animation has not begun, gaps appear between the hack text boxes and hack videos/images stacked on top of each other on both the Before You Go and When in Oz pages. I tried to use [this Autoprefixer tool](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) to correct the Safari issues but when I copied and pasted the CSS code back into Gitpod, over 200 issues were displayed in the 'Problems' area along from the Terminal. 
* To make the hack videos play within their containers on mobile devices '?playsinline=1' wording was added to the end of the video links in the Before You Go and When in Oz pages as otherwise the videos (bar one) were automatically playing full screen, not giving the user the option to view them within the webpage and because one of the videos wasn't automatically playing full screen the look of the website was inconsistent. However, making the videos play within their containers, means that the button that allows the user to make the video full screen is not present on the iPhone 5S except where the video is viewed in landscape on Chrome. I tested adding '&fs=1' ([which I found in the YouTube Embedded Player Parameters site here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters)) to the end of one of the video links to see if that worked but it did not. It would be good to perhaps try and find a JavaScript solution for a later release which would cause all videos to automatically display full screen on iPhone 5S but display within the video containers on other mobile devices.  
* On the Contact page on laptop/monitor in the Safari browser, the dropdown box appears to have a light haze compared to the other browsers.
