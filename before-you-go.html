                <h3>#1 Choose a Practical Backpack</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Many backpackers will take a traditional pack which only opens from the top. I would recommend taking a pack that
                    opens all the way around as it makes it so much easier to find what you are looking for! It's a personal preference but 
                    unless you are also planning to travel around Asia or other countries as well as Australia, and if you can afford the extra weight, 
                    there aren't many places in Oz where you can't wheel a bag so why not get a pack that has foldaway straps and wheels to get the best of both worlds?
                    I also found it really useful to have a day pack that clipped onto my main pack. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    There are a huge variety of packs on the market but I have the Osprey 
                    Fairview pack as shown in the video (male version is the Farpoint series). Also check out

                    for great packs at reduced prices.

                <h3>#2 Useful Random Items to Take</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A travel pillow is great for a bit of comfort on transport or to take camping. The 
                    <a href="https://www.trespass.com/travel/travel-pillows" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Visit travel pillows for sale at Trespass (opens in a new tab)">Trespass Packaway Travel Pillow</a>
                    has always served me well. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A sleeping bag liner is very useful for camping as often sleeping bags are provided on tours in Oz but who knows whether or how often they have been washed! 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A tube of travel wash and a travel washing line are great for washing clothes on the go. I also took a travel sink plug as most hostels don't have plugs in the 
                    sinks. If you're taking some half decent clothes with you, some colour catchers are also great to minimise the number of machine washes you have to pay for in 
                    hostels whilst keeping your clothes looking good.  
                </p>

                <h3>#3 What Clothes to Pack?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Unless you are going to move north for the winter, it does get cold in Australia despite what you might have been told! If you do something like a camping trip in the outback
                    it can drop to below 0 degrees at night and on some tours you sleep under the stars. Make sure that you take some lightweight thermal clothing, a beanie and a warm jacket. I took
                    a lightweight down jacket which rolled up into a compression bag. A couple of sets of gym clothes are also great for more active days and some nice clothes for nights out in the city. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Check out the video for top tips on minimalist packing. For a suggested list of what to pack 
                    <a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/blog/australia-packing-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Visit HostelWorld's article on what to pack for Australia (opens in a new tab)">HostelWorld</a>
                    has some great tips. A laundry bag and shoe bags are also a good idea to keep dirty clothes and shoes separate. 
                </p>
                <br> 
                <p>
                    I'd suggest taking a maximum of 17kgs if your bag has wheels
                    and 15kgs if not as carrying around a heavy bag in the heat is no fun! 
                </p>

                <h3>#4 Entertainment</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Although you will be meeting a lot of new people and seeing new places, there will be a lot of downtime on transport when you're getting from place to place and there 
                    will be times when you want a bit of quiet "me time" amidst the daily hustle and bustle of hostel life. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A laptop is a great idea for watching movies (and for writing CVs and applying for jobs). If you want something a bit smaller I found an ipad 
                    mini to be great. A Kindle is also ideal for book lovers without the hassle of carrying around heavy books (although a lot of hostels do have 
                    'book swaps' if e-readers aren't your thing). A music streaming service like Spotify is also a must along with good quality
                    headphones. Services like Netflix will work in Oz (you'll just get access to what's available in Australia) but be aware that some apps like SkyGo
                    won't work without a VPN app. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I wouldn't bother with a guide book as they usually become quickly outdated, they're heavy to carry around and you can get up-to-date
                    recommendations from your hostel or from sites like Tripadvisor (click on the <i class="fab fa-tripadvisor"></i> logo in the footer below).

                <h3>#5 Key Travel Documents</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Firstly, make sure that your passport will not expire before you plan to return from your trip!</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Secondly, you're going to need to sort out your Australian visa. Click on
                    the <i class="far fa-file-alt"></i> logo in the footer below to be taken to the Australian government's visa page, but two of the most common visas for backpackers are
                    a 12 month working holiday visa (WHV) (subclass 417) or a 3 month Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) tourist visa (subclass 601). 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Some key points with the WHV is that it is a 12 month visa, is age restricted (18-30 for most countries although up to 35 for a few), you have to be a citizen of and hold a passport for a 
                    qualifying country and you can apply for a second 12 month visa and even a third if you complete regional work (usually farm work). The WHV allows you to work for the 
                    same employer for a maximum of 6 months in most cases. This visa also comes at a cost. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The ETA visa does not have age restrictions but only allows you to stay in Australia for a maximum of 3 months and you cannot work on this visa but it is free with just a 
                    small service charge for online application. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    For both of these visas you have to enter Australia within 12 months of your visa grant date BUT your visa period doesn't start running until you enter Australia so make 
                    sure you apply well ahead of the date you want to go. Please remember that if you enter Australia and then leave to e.g. go home for a month or to a different country, 
                    this WON'T stop your visa period from continuing to run. The video has some useful guidance on visas but it is from 2019 so you should always check the Australian government's 
                    page for the most up-to-date information and to check the best visa for your circumstances. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Lastly, even if you're not planning on hiring a campervan or a car in Oz, I would still suggest taking 
                    your driving licence to use as ID on nights out instead of your passport! 
                </p>

                <h3>#6 Journey Comfort</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A flight to Australia is probably going to be the longest flight you have ever been on so it pays to try and make it as comfortable as possible!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I would suggest wearing baggy lightweight trousers and shoes with laces that you can loosen if your ankles swell during the flight. It can get cold on flights so be sure
                    to pack some warm socks and a jumper. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I used to book flights that stopped off for a few hours part way through. They are often cheaper than direct flights as well. One of my top tips is to pick a flight
                    that stops off at an airport with shower facilities. I used to stop off at Abu Dhabi because you could hire a very nice and clean shower cubicle 
                    and sink area with things like body wash provided. Having a shower part way through the journey, brushing my teeth and re-applying fresh makeup used to make me feel a 
                    lot better!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I would suggest taking a large empty water bottle which you can take through security and fill up at a water fountain before getting on the plane. This will save money
                    and avoids you having to ask the flight attendants for repeated tiny cups of water! I also found it useful to take a hydrating facial mist like 
                    <a href="https://www.avene.co.uk/hydrance-hydrating-mist-100ml" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Visit Hydrance Hydrating Mist for sale on Eau Thermale Avene's UK site (opens in a new tab)"></a>
                    to relieve the dry face I always get on flights.
