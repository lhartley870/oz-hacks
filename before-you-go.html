                <h3>#1 Choose a Practical Backpack</h3>
                <p>
                    Many backpackers will take a traditional pack which only opens from the top. I would recommend taking a pack that
                    opens all the way around as it makes it so much easier to find what you are looking for! It's a personal preference but 
                    unless you are also planning to travel around Asia or other countries as well as Australia, and if you can afford the extra weight, 
                    there aren't many places in Oz where you can't wheel a bag so why not get a pack that has foldaway straps and wheels to get the best of both worlds?
                    I also found it really useful to have a day pack that clipped onto my main pack. There are a huge variety of packs on the market but I have the Osprey 
                    Fairview pack as shown in the video (male version is the Farpoint series). Also check out

                    for great packs at reduced prices.

                <h3>#2 Useful Random Items to Take</h3>
                <p>
                    A travel pillow is great for a bit of comfort on transport or to take camping. The 
                    <a href="https://www.trespass.com/travel/travel-pillows" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Visit travel pillows for sale at Trespass (opens in a new tab)">Trespass Packaway Travel Pillow</a>
                    has always served me well. A sleeping bag liner is very useful for camping as often sleeping bags are provided on tours in Oz but who knows whether or how often they have been washed! A tube of travel wash and a travel washing line
                    are great for washing clothes on the go. I also took a travel sink plug as most hostels don't have plugs in the sinks. If you're taking some half decent clothes with you, some colour catchers are also great
                    to minimise the number of machine washes you have to pay for in hostels whilst keeping your clothes looking good.

                <h3>#3 What Clothes to Pack?</h3>
                <p>
                    Unless you are going to move north for the winter, it does get cold in Australia despite what you might have been told! If you do something like a camping trip in the outback
                    it can drop to below 0 degrees at night and on some tours you sleep under the stars. Make sure that you take some lightweight thermal clothing, a beanie and a warm jacket. I took
                    a lightweight down jacket which rolled up into a compression bag. A couple of sets of gym clothes are also great for more active days and some nice clothes for nights out in the city. 
                    Check out the video for top tips on minimalist packing. For a suggested list of what to pack

                    has some great tips. A laundry bag and shoe bags are also a good idea to keep dirty clothes and shoes separate.
