                <h3>#1 Choose a Practical Backpack</h3>
                <p>
                    Many backpackers will take a traditional pack which only opens from the top. I would recommend taking a pack that
                    opens all the way around as it makes it so much easier to find what you are looking for! It's a personal preference but 
                    unless you are also planning to travel around Asia or other countries as well as Australia, and if you can afford the extra weight, 
                    there aren't many places in Oz where you can't wheel a bag so why not get a pack that has foldaway straps and wheels to get the best of both worlds?
                    I also found it really useful to have a day pack that clipped onto my main pack. There are a huge variety of packs on the market but I have the Osprey 
                    Fairview pack as shown in the video. Also check out

                    for great packs at reduced prices.

                <h3>#2 Useful Random Items to Take</h3>
                <p>
                    A travel pillow is great for a bit of comfort on transport or to take camping. The 
                    <a href="https://www.trespass.com/travel/travel-pillows" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Visit travel pillows for sale at Trespass (opens in a new tab)" class="links">Trespass Packaway Travel Pillow</a>
                    has always served me well. A sleeping bag liner is very useful for camping tours as often sleeping bags are provided and who knows whether they have been washed! A tube of travel wash and a travel washing line
                    are great for washing clothes on the go. I also took a travel sink plug as most hostels don't have plugs in the sinks. If you're taking some half decent clothes with you, some colour catchers are also great
                    to minimise the number of machine washes you have to pay for in hostels whilst keeping your clothes looking good.
