                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Hostels are the usual accommodation of choice in Australia for backpackers due to their low cost and
                        the ability to meet fellow travellers. If you will be staying somewhere long term I would recommend going
                        for a smaller hostel which will give you the chance to make friends with other long-termers. My top tips
                        for staying in hostels are:  
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Wear flip-flops in the showers!</li>
                        <li>Use a padlock to secure your valuables in a locker</li>
                        <li>Look for hostels that offer free breakfast</li>
                        <li>Try and get a bottom bunk and tuck your beach towel under the top bunk mattress to create a privacy curtain</li>
                        <li>Hostel fridges often get warm so buy meat the same day you're going to eat it</li>
                        <li>Keep any treats like chocolate in your locker because they often go 'missing' if left in the kitchen!</li>
                    </ol> 
                    <br>

                    <h3>#2 Tours</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        It is definitely worthwhile booking some trips and tours but which ones will depend on what sort of backpacking experience you want. If you want to go with a younger party crowd then
                        a backpacker travel agent like 
                        <a href="https://peterpans.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Visit the Peterpans Adventure Travel backpacker travel website (opens in a new tab)">Peterpans Adventure Travel</a>
                        or recommendations from your hostel will be your best bet. 
                        I started my time in Australia with Intro Travel and booked an East Coast package with them which was a good mix of party places and trips with smaller crowds. You can check out their website
                        <a href="https://www.introtravel.com/tours/australia/oz-intro/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIk_6H8fCZ8QIVO4BQBh2JwweyEAAYASAAEgLtlPD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Visit Intro Travel's

                        I also booked a number of trips myself and would highly recommend the following: 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>3 Islands Whale Shark Dive, Exmouth</li>
                        <li>Litchfield Park with Jumping Crocodile Cruise, Darwin</li>
                        <li>Kangaroo Island Adventure Tours, Adelaide</li>
                        <li>Raging Thunder Adventures, Tully River Full Day White Water Rafting</li>
                        <li>Skydive Mission Beach</li>

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        If you're going to be on a Working Holiday Visa you'll need to open a bank account. Commonwealth Bank and ANZ are two of the 
                        biggest banks in Australia and have useful apps to help you manage your money. I was with Commonwealth and was also able to open 
                        a savings account to put aside some money from my wages. With Commonwealth you can apply to open your account up to 3 months 
                        before arriving in Australia so you can transfer money before you go. You'll then need to go to your chosen branch when you arrive
                        in Australia to complete the process. Check out  
                        <a href="https://www.commbank.com.au/moving-to-australia/banking.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Visit Commonwealth Bank Australia's webpage on

                    <p>
                        You will need to have received your Tax File Number (TFN) before you go to your branch which you
                        can apply for on the

                    <h3>#4 Budgeting</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Australia is an expensive country so save money where you can!
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Many hostels will let you do work such as cleaning for free accommodation. This is a great way to save money as accommodation will be one of your biggest costs. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Transport is also expensive so walk where you can and get to know the places you visit! If you're travelling one of the coastlines be sure to get a hop-on hop-off bus ticket
                        that will allow you to travel flexibly for a set price. Also in some cities ride shares are available from the airport which can turn out to be cheaper than getting a train if there 
                        are three or four travellers. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Save money on haircuts by finding a fellow traveller qualified as a hairdresser in your hostel! There are usually one or two per hostel and some even advertise!
                    </p>

                    <h3>#5 City Transport</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        When you're travelling around any of the major cities, be sure to get yourself a travel card to use on public transport such as trains, buses and ferries. 
                        You can usually top up the money on your card with an app and can just tap on and off transport as you go. Alternatively you may be able to pay with a contactless 
                        bank card instead but don't rely on buying single trip tickets with cash as sometimes you can't. It's worth getting a travel card as you tend to get cheaper 
                        rates and other benefits but don't forget to 'tap off' at the end of your journey otherwise you'll be charged with the highest trip fare! 
                        The travel cards for the main cities are:   
                    </p>

                    <ol>

                    <h3>#6 Australian Slang</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Like any country in the world, Australia has its own slang terms and it helps to know a few! The video covers a lot but there are a few 
                        additional terms I came across when I was in Oz.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>'Far out' is used when you can't believe or are amazed by something.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        If an Australian says that something 'is giving them the sh*ts', don't worry it doesn't mean that they need to go to the bathroom! It means that
                        something or someone is really annoying them. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        A 'stubby' is a beer and a 'stubby holder' is an insulated holder that you slot your beer into to keep it cold, made of a wetsuit like material. 
                    </p>
