                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Hostels are the usual accommodation of choice in Australia for backpackers due to their low cost and
                        the ability to meet fellow travellers. If you will be staying somewhere long term I would recommend going
                        for a smaller hostel which will give you the chance to make friends with other long-termers. My top tips
                        for staying in hostels are:  
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Wear flip-flops in the showers!</li>
                        <li>Use a padlock to secure your valuables in a locker</li>
                        <li>Look for hostels that offer free breakfast</li>
                        <li>Try and get a bottom bunk and tuck your beach towel under the top bunk mattress to create a privacy curtain</li>
                        <li>Hostel fridges often get warm so buy meat the same day you're going to eat it</li>
                        <li>Keep any treats like chocolate in your locker because they often go 'missing' if left in the kitchen!</li>
                    </ol> 
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        If you're going to be on a Working Holiday Visa you'll need to open a bank account. Commonwealth Bank and ANZ are two of the 
                        biggest banks in Australia and have useful apps to help you manage your money. I was with Commonwealth and was also able to open 
                        a savings account to put aside some money from my wages. With Commonwealth you can apply to open your account up to 3 months 
                        before arriving in Australia so you can transfer money before you go. You'll then need to go to your chosen branch when you arrive
                        in Australia to complete the process. Check out

                    <p>
                        You will need to have received your Tax File Number (TFN) before you go to your branch which you
                        can apply for on the
